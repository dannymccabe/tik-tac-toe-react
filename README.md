## A React Tik Tac Toe Game

* Lets you play tic-tac-toe,
* Indicates when a player has won the game,
* Stores a game’s history as a game progresses,
* Allows players to review a game’s history and see previous versions of a game’s board.


### What I learned 
This was an introduction to react using mostly class-based components. It was a great exercise in managing state and passing props. I learned how to lift state to hire level components.
